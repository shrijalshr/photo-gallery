# photo-gallery is an ionic application that I built following the official documentation of ionicframework.

<h1>What We'll Build</h1>
<br>
We'll create a Photo Gallery app that offers the ability to take photos with your device's camera, display them in a grid, and store them permanently on the device.

Highlights include:

<ul>
<li>
One Angular-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework UI components.
</li>
<li>
Deployed as a native iOS and Android mobile app using Capacitor, Ionic's official native app runtime.
</li><li>

</li>

Photo Gallery functionality powered by the Capacitor Camera, Filesystem, and Storage APIs.

  </ul
